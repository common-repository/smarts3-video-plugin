== Description ==

The SmartS3 Video Plugin lets you easily embed videos from Amazon S3 in your WordPress blog. Here's a list of
the key features of SmartS3:

* **Shortcode Generator.** Embed videos from Amazon S3 into your WordPress blog without hassling with all
the technical details yourself. Use the built-in shortcode generator to add a new video with just a couple
mouse clicks.

* **Signed URLs.** Leave your videos protected on Amazon S3, because SmartS3 generates signed URLs for every
video you embed... automatically. This ensures no one can browse your Amazon S3 videos directly. In addition,
every singed URL has an expiration date. So, even if someone paste the entire signed URL onto a sharing site,
that URL will expire after a set amount of time (which you can customize).

* **HTML5 Support.** Let your videos play in nearly every device known to man. SmartS3 uses an advanced detection
routine to detect what browser and version a user is viewing your video with. Then, based on that detection, it
displays the correct player (HTML5 or Flash). This detection is based on the H.264 video codec. This means, you
can upload ONE (properly encoded) H.264 file and it will play in nearly every browser and device.

This has been specifically tested with the following browsers and devices:

Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, iPad, iPhone, iTouch, Android, and GoogleTV.

* **JW Player Support.** SmartS3 comes bundled with FlowPlayer; however, it includes support for the JW Player. Due
to LongTailVideo's licensing restrictions, SmartS3 does not come bundled with JW Player; however, you can download
JW Player yourself, copy a couple files to SmartS3 and be on your way. You are required to understand and abide by
LongTailVideo's licensing restrictions.
